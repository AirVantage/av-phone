av-phone
========

An android application to monitor the state of the phone and send this state periodically to the AirVantage platform.

The official application is available on the [App Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sierrawireless.avphone)

The code is published here only as an example of how to use the AirVantage APIs from an Android Application. 

##Â Configuration

You'll need to edit the 'assets/avphone.properties' file to specify Airvantage API clients on the NA and EU instances
(respectively).

If the API clients are missing, the "login" pages will display an error page ("Something went wrong".)
